sed: can't read configs/ior_configurations_test.csv: No such file or directory
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open MPI has detected that a parameter given to a command line
option does not match the expected format:

  Option: n
  Param:  ./ior

This is frequently caused by omitting to provide the parameter
to an option that requires one. Please check the command line and try again.
